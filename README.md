# matplotlib-tumor-drug-analysis


## Overview:

In this project, I performed a visual examination of tumor development in mice subjected to various drug treatments. The study involved 249 mice diagnosed with SCC tumors who received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over a span of 45 days, tumor development was closely observed and measured. The primary objective of this study was to assess and compare the efficacy of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against other treatment regimens.
